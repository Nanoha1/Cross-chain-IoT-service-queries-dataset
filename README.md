# Cross-chain-IoT-service-queries-dataset
To overcome the lack of publicly available IoT service repositories, we merged three public datasets to build the experimental dataset:  By combining 108,536 service records from IoT devices such as ThingSpeak-LED, Wipro-Bulb, and MQTT-Temp, we cover 28 IoT domains, including domotics, car sharing, and e-healthcare.
